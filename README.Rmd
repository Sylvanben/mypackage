# mypackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of mypackage is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of mypackage from github

``` r
devtools::install_github(Sylvanben/mypackage)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mypackage)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
howiya("tony")
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
